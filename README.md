# ML-Salary-estimation-using-K-NEAREST-NEIGHBOUR
    1.Finding the problem - > PRedicting wheather applicant got salary above 50K or not from previous company - HR
    2.collecting Dataset - > Age, Education,capital gain,hoursper week( 4 inputs), income -> 1 output
    3.Load & summerize the data sets 
    4.Mapping Data from text to Binary numbers ( income column)
    5.Segragate the date in to X and y depending on independent and dependent variable,
    6.Splitting dataset in to train and test
    7.Feature scalling to mainitain the scare of futute to avaoid higher weightage on single feature, to avoiding biasing Can be achieved by Normalization Standardization
    8.Algorithm - K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR - >Classifier -> based on minkonwski distance matrix -> Euclidean =2 or Manhattan = 1 distance
    9.Finding the best k value - > get least mean error
    10.Training -> training the model with preprocessed dataset
    11.Validation -> using confusion matrix
    12.Prediction -> observe how the model is performing in new data.
